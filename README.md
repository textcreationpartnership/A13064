      * Verſe. 5 The cordes of death encompaſſed me: And the flouddes of Beliall ſore troubled me.Verſe. 6 The cordes of hel encompaſſed me: the ſnares of death preuented me.

      * Verſe 7 In my trouble did I call vpon the Lorde, and cryed vnto my God, and he heard me out of his holy place, and in his ſight, entred into his eares.

      * Verſe 8 The earth was mooued, and quaked with feare: And the founda ions of the hilles were troubled, and did ſhrinke, becauſe he was angrie therewith.Verſe 9 There aroſe a ſmoke in his wrath, and a fire from before his face burned: And coales were kindled thereat.Verſe 10 He bowed the heauens and came down, and a darkenes was vnder his feete:Verſe 11 And he was caried vpon the Cherubins, and did flie vpon the winges of the winde.Verſe 12 And he made darkenes his ſecrete place in the compas of his Tabernacle: A darke water and thicke Clowdes.Verſe 13 From lightning in his ſight, there paſſed away his cloudes: Haile and coales of fire.Verſe 14 And the Lord thundered from heauen, and the moſt higheſt gaue foorth his voice, haile and coales of fire.Verſe 15 And he ſent his arrowes, and ſcattered them▪ He increaſed lightninge, and troubled them.Verſe 16 And the welſpringes of waters opened, a• the foundations of the whole world were diſcloſed, at thy rebuke, O Lord, at the blaſt of the breath of thy wrath.

      * Verſe 36 And thou haſt geuen me a ſheelde of my ſaluation, and thy right hand comforteth me, and with thy meeknes doeſt magnifie me.Verſe 37 Thou haſt enlarged my goinges vnder me, and my foote ſteppes, are not weakened.Verſe 38 I will perſecute mine enimies, and I will ouertake them. And I will not returne till I ſhall deſtroye thē.Verſe 39 I will bruiſe them, that they ſhall not be able to ſtand, they ſhall falle vnder my feete.Verſe 40 Aad thou haſt foregirded me with ſtrength vnto battle, and thou haſt ouerthrowne them that riſe againſt me, vnder me.Verſe 41 And thou haſt made mine enimies to turne theire backes vnto me, and haſt ſcatered them that hate me.Verſe 42 They cryed, and there was none to ſaue them, euen to the Lord, but he heard them not.Verſe 43 And I will beate them to peeces, like the duſt before the face of the winde, as the claye in the ſtreetes will I diſtroy them.

      * Verſe 44 Thou ſhalt delyuer me from the gaineſayinge of the people, thou ſhalt ſet me in authoritie ouer nations, a people whome I haue not knowne ſhall ſerue me.Verſe 45 With attentiūe eare ſhall they obey me, ſtraunge Children haue diſſembled with me.Verſe 46 Straunge children are worne away, and they haue trembled in theire aduerſities.

      * Verſe 47 The Lord liueth, and bleſſed be my ſtronge God, and let the God of my ſaluation be magnified.Verſe 48 It is God that reuengeth my cauſe, & bringeth people in ſubiection vnder me.Verſe 49 Thou art my deliuerer from mine enimies, and from them that riſe againſt me, ſhalt thou exalt me, and deliuer me from the vngodlie perſon.Verſe 50 For this cauſe will I magnifie thee, amonge the nations, oh Lord, and will ſinge a Pſalme vnto thy name.Verſe 51 Thou that exalteſt the welfare of the kinge, and performeſt mercies vnto Dauid thine anoynted, and vnto his ſeede euen for euer and euer.
